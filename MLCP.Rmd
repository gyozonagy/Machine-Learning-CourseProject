#This machine learning project is based on the data provided by the following 
#source:   http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har



# reading the two files
# this file contains over 19000 training samples regarding movment patterns featuring 6 individuals
# the movement fall into 5 categories "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E"
training = read.csv("pml-training.csv" , header = TRUE)

# we are provided with 20 movement patterns, accopanied by the individuals who performed them, but the "categiry" 
# of the movement is missing. Our tast is to predict categories A-E, based upon the above training data.
testing = read.csv("pml-testing.csv" , header = TRUE)

# first we perform data cleansing, we remove unnecessary features, out of the more the 160 provided. 
# identifying the colums containing "NA" values. 
na_list=NULL
for (i in 1:160) {
  if (sum(is.na(training[i])) > 1) {
  na_list= c(na_list,i)
  }
}
# removing the colums containing "NA" values.

    emp_list= c(emp_list,i)
    #print(sum(training[i]==''))
  }
}
# removing the colums containing "NULL" values. 
training <- training[-emp_list]
testing <- testing[-emp_list]

#removing the first 6 non significant columns from test set.
testing <- testing[-1:-6]

# wellknown fact, that the movment patterns of a person is very specific to the person
# so it is wise thing to split our data according to the user names.
adelmo <- subset(training,training$user=="adelmo") 
adelmo <- adelmo[-1:-6]
carlitos <- subset(training,training$user=="carlitos")

#I splitted every user's data int a train and a test set, into 60% / 40% partitions,
# and run the "randomforest" method for all of the remaining 54 features, see this for "Adelmo" below:

library(caret)

                               p=0.6, list=FALSE)
train_adelmo <- adelmo[inTrain,]
test_adelmo <- adelmo[-inTrain,]
mod_ad <- train(classe~ .,method="rf",data=train_adelmo)
# using mod_xx (here: ad) for predicting the result over the 40% of the remaining data 
# at least 99% accuracy occured for all of the users!! 
# by contrast, the accuracy of the prediction of different user's training ang testing sets 
# found surprisingly low, between 15%-40%, proving our initial hypoteses about the specificity of 
# personal moving patters. 


ad_pred <- predict(mod_ad,testing[-54]) # adelmo's perdiction:
#E  E  E  A* A  E  E  E  A  E  E  E  E  E  E  A  E  A  E  A

#A  A* B* A  A  E* D* B* A  E  B  C* A  A* E* A  A  A  A  A

pe_pred <- predict(mod_pe,testing[-54]) # pedro's prediction:
#B* D  D  E  D  D  D  D  D  D  C  D  D  D  D  D  A* D  B* D

eu_pred <- predict(mod_eu,testing[-54]) # eurico's prediction:
#A  A  A  A  A* A  E  E  A  E  A  A  B* A  E  E* A  E  A  B*

#E  E  E  A  A  E  E  E  A* E  B* E  A  E  E  A  E  B* E  A

ch_pred <- predict(mod_ch,testing[-54]) # charles's prediction:
#A  B  A  E  A  A  A  A  A  A* A  A  A  A  A  A  E  A  A  B

# we used '*' to identify the predictions where the training user is the same as test user.
# in every column there is only such prediction. These must be highly accurate predictions!!
# by submitting them  20 out of 20 score received.
